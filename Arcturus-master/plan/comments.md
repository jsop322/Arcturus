# Project plan comments from Miikka

Good overall plan. Some comments:

  * Class structure looks good and justified.

  * Project schedule is well put together keeping in mind the milestones.

  * Division of work is detailed.

  * Do you have a main platform you are using for development and
    testing the software?

**Score: 3/3**
